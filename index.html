        <h2>A Portfolio For Harry Simpson</h2>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Harry! I am a 21 year old aspiring game developer from Sheffield, UK. My skills predominantly lie with Unity and C# as these are the software and language I have spent the most time with. However, that being said, I am keen to learn new languages, software and skills to expand my abilities. My hobbies include playing video games and making test game development projects. While playing games, I often find myself wondering how the developers created some of the features and functions of their games and, in some cases, I create a test project in Unity to try and recreate these features. As well as knowledge of Unity and C#, I also have skills for graphics design, regarding UI and music composition.</p>

        <img src="cellborn.png" alt="Cellborn" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 25%; height: 25%;">
        <p>Made for my final year university game development module, Cellborn is a top-down, isometric fantasy shooter where you play as an elf named Elvin, questing to escape the Evil Wizard's tower. Cellborn was made in Unity and is a collaborative effort between four programmers and four artists, and features procedural generation and unique weapons. My responsibilities during this project were the development of the weapons system, the potions, the HUD, the main menu, the settings menu, the introduction cutscene and the composition and implementation of the music.</p>
