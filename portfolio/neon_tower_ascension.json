    "experience": "Neon Tower Ascension began development in September 2023 after Unity announced its controversial Runtime Fee. I began looking for alternatives to Unity and started with Unreal Engine as, at the time, it seemed to be the second most popular choice for a game engine. I decided to create a simple 3D platformer game since it seemed like a good, easy, and simple first project to tackle.",
