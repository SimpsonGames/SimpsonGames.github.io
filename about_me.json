            "body":"My name is Harry! I am a 23 year old aspiring game developer from Sheffield, UK. My skills predominantly lie with Unity and C# as these are the software and language I have spent the most time with. However, that being said, I am keen to learn new languages, software and skills to expand my abilities. My hobbies include playing video games and making test game development projects. While playing games, I often find myself wondering how the developers created some of the features and functions of their games and, in some cases, I create a test project in Unity to try and recreate these features. As well as knowledge of Unity and C#, I also have skills for graphics design, regarding UI and music composition."

            "body":"I first began developing games in January of 2015 in the Clickteam Fusion 2.5 software, which has been used in the past to create Five Nights at Freddy’s, The Escapists and Baba Is You. While using Clickteam Fusion, I gained knowledge in both game logic, maths and design by creating small but simple games that I could easily complete on my own. Between 2015 and 2018, Clickteam Fusion 2.5 was the main software I stuck with until 2019 when I began the transition to a new language since Clickteam provided no practice for any programming languages. Initially, I began learning GameMaker: Studio in order to begin to learn game development through code editing as opposed to Clickteam’s event-based system. However, after a while, I wanted to learn to create 3D games so I transitioned to Unity and C#. Since learning Unity, I have taken part in three game jams, two for University and one in my spare time, and I have had the opportunity to utilise and improve my skills by working as part of a team for a game development module at university."

            "body":"In the future, I aim to take part in more game jams in order to create more games for my portfolio, begin learning additional languages and software such as Unreal Engine 4/5, Godot and C++ and create and deploy games for a variety of systems beyond Windows computers (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Mobile). While I have used Unreal Engine 4 previously for a university module and have very basic knowledge about the engine and its nodes system, I believe there is a great deal more that I can learn such as using Unreal Engine’s scripting system and C++. Additionally, in 2022, I became interested in learning the Godot engine as a potential alternative to Unity, but have not yet had or devoted enough time towards learning the engine thoroughly."
